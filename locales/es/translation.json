    "about_description_1": "We believe ideas come from everyone, everywhere. In fact, at BlackTie, everyone within our agency walls is a designer in their own right. And there are a few principles we believeâ€”and we believe everyone should believeâ€”about our design craft. These truths drive us, motivate us, and ultimately help us redefine the power of design. Weâ€™re big believers in doing right by our neighbors. After all, we grew up in the Twin Cities and we believe this place has much to offer. So we do what we can to support the community we love.",
    "about_description_2": "Over the past four years, weâ€™ve provided more than $1 million in combined cash and pro bono support to Way to Grow, an early childhood education and nonprofit organization. Other community giving involvement throughout our agency history includes pro bono work for more than 13 organizations, direct giving, a scholarship program through the Minneapolis College of Art & Design, board memberships, and ongoing participation in the Keystone Club, which gives five percent of our companyâ€™s earnings back to the community each year."
